The complexity of the near Sun solar wind has been showcased by the first occultation measurements using radio signals from a spacecraft. The fluctuations in radio frequency recorded during conjunction events can provide insight into plasma turbulence in the solar wind. In 1965, the Mariner IV spacecraft used radio occultation to measure the atmosphere of Mars, using the technique of observing changes in phase, frequency, and amplitude of radio signals as they pass through the atmosphere. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of the Doppler method as a means of observing the Solar corona and wind. The period of observation for this study
is from October 2 to October 14, 2021, with the heliocentric distance between 5 - 9 RâŠ™ . The velocity for the stipulated distance and time period is obtained in the range of 112-260 Km/s. We also present a comparison with the different electron number density models derived in the previous studies with the profiles derived from our study by using data collected during the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission in October 2021, received at the Indian Deep Space Network, Bangalore.
