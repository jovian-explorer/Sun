Radio frequency fluctuations recorded during solar conjunctions can provide information about plasma turbulence in the solar wind. In this study, we derive the empirical radial dependence of solar wind velocity by using data collected during the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission during October 2021 which were received at the Indian Deep Space Network, Bangalore.
